# GraphQL Server Example

## What is this?
It's the example server from the [Apollo Server Docs Tutorial](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/v2/getting-started.html).

## Why is this?
I've used Apollo Client, so it was time to take a deep (okay, shallow) dive into Apollo Server and how the two work together.

## How can I use this repo?
You can actually just fork it, use `npm` or `yarn` to install the dependencies, and use `node index.js` in the root to spin up the local server. Don't though. Really. Just go through the tutorial yourself, it should take ~10min tops.
